Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located in the U.S.A..
• It was initially designed for programming in UNIX operating system.
• Now the software tool as well as the C compiler is written in C. Major parts of popular operating systems like Windows, UNIX, Linux is still written in C.

Features of C Programming Language:
• C is one of the most popular languages used today.
• C is a robust programming with an impressive set of built-in functions and a variety of operators which you can use to write any complex program.
• C programs are fast and efficient. This is because C uses a powerful set of data types and operators.
• C combines the power and capability of assembly language with the user friendly features of a high-level language.
• C is the most widely used older programming language. It continues to go strong while older programming languages such as BASIC and COBOL have been virtually forgotten.
• C is very much portable, which means programs written on a machine using C can be used on other machines as well without any modification.
• A C program consists of a number of functions that are supported by C library. In fact, you can create your own function, which can then be added to the C library.

Characteristics of C Language:
C is a General Purpose Programming Language. This means C can be used to write a variety of applications. It is often referred to as a “system programming language.”
• C is a middle level language, which means it combines the features of high level language with the functionality of an assembly language.
• C is a structured programming language, which means as a programmer, you are required to divide a problem into a several different modules or functions.
• C is renowned for its simplicity and is easy to use because of its structured approach. It has a vast collection of keywords, operators, built-in functions and data types which make it efficient and powerful.
• C is portable, which means a C program runs in different environments. C compilers are available for all operating systems and hardware platforms. Additionally, you can easily write code on one system and port it to another.
• C is popular not just because it can be used as a standalone programming language, but also as it can be used as an interface to other more visual languages.
